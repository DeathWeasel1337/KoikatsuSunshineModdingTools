This mod is an example of how to create clothing.

Clothing can be difficult to create from scratch as it requires rigging it to the body mesh. However, clothing mods that are texture edits are fairly simple to create. For example, bras and panties mostly use the same mesh with different textures. The clothing used in this example is a bra mod using a modified bra mesh to better show cleavage. Textures applied to this mesh are interchangable with the vanilla bra mesh as the UV map is mostly the same. This mesh is free to use and modify to your liking.

Clothing requires a ChaClothesComponent MonoBehavior in order to function properly. Select the prefab and you will see both the high poly and low poly version have it. The high poly version two meshes in the RendNormal array, the mesh for the on state and the mesh for the half-off state. The low poly model has no half-off state. To configure these meshes, drag and drop the prefab in to the Hierarchy window, then in the Inspector window click the circle next to Element 0 and you will see the meshes in the list. Select one and click Apply to update the prefab. You can then safely delete it from the Heirarchy.

Clothes also require a MainTex and a ColorMask, without them they won't display correctly. These two textures do not need to be applied to the material and the clothing shaders don't even have a ColorMask property. These textures must be added to the list file. Because these textures are not assigned to a material, you must select them and build them to the same asset bundle as the clothes prefabs, simply assigning the prefab to an asset bundle alone will not add these textures to the asset bundle.

The Use Color N01 etc. checkboxes in the ChaClothesComponent will enable or disable color options in the character maker. The Default Colors on the ChaClothesComponent override colors set on the material, these colors are what color the clothes become when resetting the color in the character maker.
