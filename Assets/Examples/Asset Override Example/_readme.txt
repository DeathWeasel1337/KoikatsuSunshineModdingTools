This mod is an example of how to override vanilla assets. abdata\chara\mt_eye_00.unity3d contains textures for the irises, cf_t_expression_00 within that asset bundle is the heart pupils texture. This mod compiles a texture with the same name to the same asset bundle. Sideloader will always load assets from zipmods before trying to load from vanilla assets, so this asset will be loaded in its place.

Unity will generate CAB-strings based on the file name of an asset bundle and so no two files will typically have the same CAB-string. However, since Sideloader allows you to override assets such as with this mod, the two asset bundles will have the same CAB-string which will cause an error. To avoid this, mod_settings.xml is used to mark the asset bundle as one that should have its CAB-string randomized. There shouldn't be a need to use this for anything other than asset bundles that override assets but if you find yourself with a CAB-string conflict you can use this file to avoid that.

Typically, overriding assets isn't necessary. Modifcations can typically be made on a per-character basis using things like MaterialEditor or Overlays, or substantial changes compiled in to separate mods. These types of mods are generally used for fixing broken vanilla assets, but in this case it is modifying a texture that isn't otherwise editable for the end user.

Mods that override assets can be dangerous. Users that extract them can damage their install by overwriting a vanilla asset bundle with a partial asset bundle. Always take care to distribute these mods with the .zipmod extension to reduce the chance of this happening.
