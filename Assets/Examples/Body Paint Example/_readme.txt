This mod shows how to create a body paint mod.

The manifest.xml is inside the root folder. Inside the List\Maker folder is the list file for the mod. Thumbnails are inside the Thumbnail folder. The Texture2D folder holds the body paint textures. These files are .psd files, however Unity allows you to use a variety of file types. Use whatever suits your workflow the best. Select these files and you will see in the bottom left the AssetBundle path. This is where Unity will compile the asset bundles and the list file should match.
